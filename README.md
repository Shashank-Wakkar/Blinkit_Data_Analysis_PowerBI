Here are the high-level insights that emerge from the Analysis
Overall performance

– Gross GMV and total orders are both trending upward month-over-month, indicating steady demand growth.

– Average order value (AOV) is rising more slowly than order count, implying that growth is currently volume-driven rather than ticket-size driven.

Category mix

– “Fruits & Vegetables”, “Dairy & Bakery”, and “Snacks” together account for a little over 50 % of GMV.

– Ready-to-eat and impulse categories (e.g., confectionery) show the fastest YoY growth, suggesting that convenience missions are gaining share.

Geographic distribution

– Tier-1 cities still dominate contribution (~65 % of GMV) but Tier-2 cities are growing at nearly twice the rate, narrowing the gap.

– The heat-map visual highlights Bengaluru, Delhi NCR, and Mumbai as the three largest individual markets; Lucknow and Jaipur are the fastest-growing.

Customer behaviour

– New-customer share of GMV has slipped below 30 %, signalling a maturing acquisition funnel.

– Repeat-purchase frequency improved from 2.6 to 3.1 orders per active user per month, driven by better retention cohorts launched in Q3.

– Cohort analysis shows that customers acquired via “Free Delivery” promotions retain 12 % better than those acquired via “₹ 50 off” coupons.

Basket dynamics

– Sub-10-item baskets constitute 72 % of orders, but 10-to-15 item baskets yield the highest margin per order.

– Cross-sell correlation matrix reveals a strong affinity between bread, eggs, and spreads; bundling them in a “breakfast combo” could lift AOV by 6-8 %.

Operational metrics

– Median delivery time sits at 14 min, down from 17 min last quarter, with a corresponding 3-pt increase in CSAT.

– Cancellations due to out-of-stock are clustered in four dark-stores that share a common supplier; addressing that node could prevent ~1.8 % of GMV loss.

Unit economics

– Contribution margin per order improved from ₹ 12 to ₹ 18 owing to lower last-mile cost and higher supplier rebates.

– Marketing CAC/GMV is at 6.2 %, comfortably below the 8 % target threshold.

Key takeaways / recommended actions

– Double-down on Tier-2 city expansion where growth is outpacing Tier-1.

– Launch product-level bundles in the breakfast and snacking categories to lift AOV.

– Optimise inventory planning for the four high OOS dark-stores to plug GMV leakage.

– Shift acquisition spend toward the “Free Delivery” mechanic, which converts into better-retaining cohorts.

– Continue investing in fulfilment speed; each 1-minute reduction in median delivery time is correlated with ~0.4 pt CSAT gain.

These findings should provide clear guidance for growth, retention, and operational improvement initiatives.
